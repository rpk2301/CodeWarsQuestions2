top_3_words("In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.")

For java users, the calls will actually be in the form: TopWords.top3(String s), expecting you to return a List<String>.

Bonus points (not really, but just for fun):
Avoid creating an array whose memory footprint is roughly as big as the input text.
Avoid sorting the entire array of unique words.
